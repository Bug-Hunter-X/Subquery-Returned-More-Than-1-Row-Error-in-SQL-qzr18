# Subquery Returned More Than 1 Row in SQL
This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: the `Subquery returned more than 1 row` error. It shows how this error occurs and how to fix it using `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`, or by modifying the query to return a single row.

The `bug.sql` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.sql` provides several solutions.
